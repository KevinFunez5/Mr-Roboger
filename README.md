## Here is the Test-Driven-Development (TDD) logic worked on for this project.

### TDD

> Test: "It should return an array with a 0 if the number 0 is inputted"
> Code:processNumber(0);
> Expected Output: [0]

> Test: "It should return an array of numbers up to the inputted number"
> Code:processNumber(3);
> Expected Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]

> Test: "Any string containing 1s in it, will output "Beep!"  "
> Code:processNumber(1);
> Expected Output: [0, Beep!]

> Test: "Any string containing 2s in it, will output "Boop!"  "
> Code:processNumber(2);
> Expected Output: [0, Beep!, Boop!]

> Test: "Any string containing 3s in it, will output "Won't you be my nieghbor?"  "
> Code:processNumber(3);
> Expected Output: [0, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my nieghbor?]
